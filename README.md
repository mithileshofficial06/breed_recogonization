# 🐾 Breed Recognition System using Deep Learning

A Deep Learning–based Breed Recognition System that identifies the breed of an animal from an input image.  
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract visual features and classify the breed with high accuracy.

## 📌 Project Overview

Breed recognition plays an important role in veterinary care, animal research, farming, and pet management.  
This project focuses on building an automated system that can recognize animal breeds from images using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

The system takes an image as input, processes it using a trained deep learning model, and predicts the corresponding breed.
